Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion
project liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

Aside from the usual improvements to Braille tables this release
focuses on improving the internal infrastructure. Numerous bugs have
been fixed, the CI infrastructure also checks mingw builds now and
MSVC compatibility has been massively improved. For a detailed list of
all the changes refer to
